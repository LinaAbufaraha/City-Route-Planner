# City Route Planner

## Overview
City Route Planner is a C-based program that calculates the shortest path between two cities using **Dijkstra's algorithm** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. It represents the road network as a **graph** (using an adjacency matrix) and efficiently finds the minimum distance between cities.

## Features
- Implements **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for shortest path calculation.
- Uses **BFS** to explore possible routes.
- Stores the city road network in an **adjacency matrix**.
- Provides an interactive interface for users to input cities and receive the optimal route.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C  
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Queues, Adjacency Matrix  
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm, BFS  

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
